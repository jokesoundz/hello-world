<dl>
<dt>- Is it OK to masturbate?</li>
<dt>- Do other people masturbate as much as me?</li>
<dt>- Why can't I stop myself from doing it?</li>
</dl>
<p>Did you ever ask yourself these questions?  Are you concerned that you might be addicted to masturbation?  And do you want to do something about it?
<br>Well, <strong>don't bother</strong>!  There is <strong>nothing</strong> wrong with you.  And if anyone tells you differently, show them this website!</p>
<p>Don't listen to people who tell you there's something wrong with you!  Don't listen to <a class="a" href="https://nofap.com/" target="_blank" title="honestly, is this site for real?">nofap.com</a>. Here's some advice, you should masturbate <em>more</em>!  Not less.  Discover you.  Spend more time with your body.  Learn everything there is to know about you.</p>
<h2>- Sexual Health Links -</h2>
<p>For actually useful advice about sexual health, talk to someone who won't make you feel embarrassed.  There are a few sexual health clinics in Saigon.  And there you will find helpful people who have heard it ALL.  It's OK to feel shy, but don't hide it for too long.  If something feels wrong with your body, there's no shame in talking about it.  And if you have never told anyone about your same-sex relationship, these people will listen without judgement, and will keep your conversation confidential.</p>

<dt><a class="a" href="https://www.ppcworld.com.vn/" target="_blank">Pride & Prevention Center</a></dt>
<dd>Pride & Prevention Center (PPC World) is a sexual health clinic in District 1, Saigon. The people you meet here are open and kind people.  They can test you for whichever STIs you are concerned you might have and also help you about to understand and respond appropriately to the results.</dd>
<dt><a class="a" href="https://galantclinic.com/" target="_blank">Galant Clinic</a></dt>
<dd>Galant Clinic has a few centers in different districts. As this is a clinic especially for sexual health, you will also be seen quickly here and can talk to helpful people about your sexuality and sexual concerns.</dd>
<dt><a class="a" href="https://www.fvhospital.com/ban-can-biet/tam-soat-cac-benh-ly-lay-truyen-qua-duong-tinh-duc/" target="_blank">FV Hospital - Sexual Health Screening (vn)</a></dt>
<dt><a class="a" href="https://www.fvhospital.com/learn-more/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-diseases/" target="_blank">FV Hospital - Sexual Health Screening (en)</a></dt>
<dd>FV Hospital offers screening for STDs in District 7.  You may have to pay more to be seen here, as its a rather expensive private hospital. However, in some people's case, they <em>may</em> have additional services that are useful to you in addition to those found at smaller sexual health clinics.</dd>

<p style="text-shadow: 2px 2px red;">Sexual Health Clinics (info)</p>
<p>Sexual Health Clinics are often run as small businesses.  Many are very supportive of LGBT related issues around sex and sexuality (but don't panic, you can still go there if you are heterosexual as well).  You can often get seen very quickly at these places, but it is still worth booking an appointment in advance, as opening hours can vary.  Check out the websites for more information.</p>
<p style="text-shadow: 2px 2px red;">Sexual Health Screening @ Hospitals (info)</p>
<p>In Vietnam, not all hospitals offer Sexual Health services, but some do. Going to hospital for a screening may be easier for some people, but in general, clinics are good for focussed advice and support on sexual health in Vietnam.</p>

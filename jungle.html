<h2>The Urban Jungle</h2>
<p>This is a very quick list of a few of of nightlife beginnings and nightlife endings in Saigon... the things that grow and that die of life and death.  We want to share the glory of what happens and has happened (and will happen) in Saigon with the rest of the world wide web, so here's some stories that you might know if you live here, and you might not if you don't.</p>
<p>It's common for clubs, bars and great bits of nightlife to rise and fall in Vietnam, even without COVID making things more difficult.  Here's a recent history of some of the hottest hot topics to have left a stain on the city these last couple of years.</p>

<h3>- 289e -</h3>
<p>Off-grid art bar <i>cum</i> collective of qweirdos - hosting events, serving cocktails and disrupting the traditional art circuit of Saigon. [MORE INFO COMING SOON]</p>

<h3>- ARCAN -</h3>
<p>Originally dubbed 'Asian Rave Connection', great soundsystem, great energy, short life span, but enough time to make an impact - now a mini-golf course. [MORE INFO COMING SOON]</p>

<h3>- ERROR:102 -</h3>
<p>One of the biggest impacting, shortest lived super clubs in Saigon, housed just off of the infamous Bùi Viện street, rise to fame during the beautiful gap of time between Vietnam's first and fourth waves of COVID=19.</p>

<h3>- GenderFunk -</h3>
<p>Queer collective of drag-artists, hosting parties for LGBTQ+ 'PLUS STRAIGHTS' and celebrating queer culture in Saigon and beyond. [MORE INFO COMING SOON]</p>

<h3>- Nhạc Gãy -</h3>
<p>Art collective, rave enthusiasts, pushing the boundaries of Vietnamese nightlife and putting care for individuals at the heart of responsible partying in Saigon and beyond.</p>

<h3>- Observatory -</h3>
<p>One of the most well known, dare we say 'world famous' nightclub in Saigon, has changed location more than 3 times, but still kept the same reputation for all those years.</p>

<h3>---MORE Saigon (and gone) stories MORE---</h3>
<p>There are so so soooooo many more collectives, communities, short-lived and longer-established projects that have lived and died and meant so much to so many people in Saigon, places and parties to write about and talk about... if you want to share a story, get in touch!</p>

<h2>The REAL Jungle</h2>
<p>This is not a resource, but a reminder, the jungle is threatened and threatening.  The jungle doesn't need you to survive, in fact it needs you to not survive for it to prosper.  Nature will win in this war between humanity and nature.  But if you want to take a moment to think about how you can help, get in touch with some nature.  Get off your phone.  Go to nature.  Go to the jungle.  Show her you love her, and she might be kind to you.</p>

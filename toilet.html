<p>To have a good time.</p>
<p>It's a space where you can be on your own,<br>when things get too much.</p>

<p>*<i>fap fap fap*</i>= the sound you make when you are masturbating, according to various online sources.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it OK to masturbate?</li>
<li>Do other people masturbate as much as me?</li>
<li>Why can't I stop myself from doing it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you ever ask yourself these questions?  Are you concerned that you might be addicted to masturbation?  And do you want to do something about it?
<br>Well, <strong>don't bother</strong>!  There is <strong>nothing</strong> wrong with you.  And if anyone tells you differently, show them this website!</p>
<p>You might have heard about this allegedly 'secular' organisation that wants to cure you of your addiction, it's called <a class="a" href="https://nofap.com/" target="_blank" title="honestly, is this site for real?">nofap.com</a>.  But here's some advice, you should masturbate <em>more</em>!  Not less.  Discover you.  Spend more time with you and yourself.  Only you know what you really like!</p>

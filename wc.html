<p>The toilet is a great place to think.</p>
<p>To have a good time.</p>
<p>It's a space where you can be on your own,<br>when things get too much.</p>
<p>Or you can go with other people,<br><i>for a different kind of fun.</i></p>

<p>There are some things that they don't teach you at school.</p>
<p>Most of us have to learn the <em>hard way</em>. Or, by reading cool websites like this :) By the way, if you know everything already, and this page is all, just, like, <i>"bla bla bla"</i>, you don't have to stay.</p>
<p>You can go to another room:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to:= <a class="a" href="balcony.html" title="discuss mental health">the balcony</a>.</li>
<li>Go to:= <a class="a" href="library.html" title="learn cool stuff">the library</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, you can explore the outside world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore:= <a class="a" href="jungle.html" title="Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ">the jungle</a>.</li>
<li>Explore:= <a class="a" href="space.html" title="(<>..<>)">space</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>But let's get back to THIS page already.  Here we go!</p>

<h2>- drukQs -</h2>

<p>Richard D. James released an album on Warp Records in 2001 called <em>drukQs</em>, under his popular alias, 'Aphex Twin'.  This section of the website is not about that release.</p>
<p>Or about Richard D. James.</p>
<p>But here is a gif, for funs.</p>

<!-- <p>If you're reading this page in Vietnamese, then you might be wondering why they couldn't translated the word <em>'drukQs'</em>.  That's because we are talking about something that some people still think is taboo.  We're not supposed to talk about it.  Even though so so many people are doing it.  And not 'bad' people, well maybe some bad people, buta also 'good' people who are doing it!  Who are <em>taking</em> it.  Your friends.  Even you!  But do you know the risks?  Do your friends?  Are you concerned, but don't know who to talk to about it?  Don't be afraid.  You're not the first person to be scared.  There are people out there who will listen to your questions, who want to help.-->

<!-- I don't really like that way of explaining... gotta think of something more short sharp, and to the point... also offer links to taking drugs safely, addiction, etc -->

<p>drukQs: Qs about dr<sup>u</sup>k<sub>Q</sub>s</p>

<ul>
<li>Do only bad people take them?</li>
<li>Will I get addicted?  How will I know if I'm addicted?</li>
<li>If I don't take them, am I not cool?</li>
</ul>

<h2>- Let's talk about X<sub>s</sub>X<sub>e</sub>X<sub>x</sub> baby! -</h2>

<p>We've all done it, or (hopefully) will do it at some point in our life, in fact, when we are 18+ many of us do it A LOT!!!  But how often do we talk about it???</p>

<hr style="border-style: dotted;" />

<h3>- - <i>"mum, i have to tell you something, i think i'm straight</i> - -</h3>

<p>Not something you hear very often.  Because for most people, it's okay to be straight, and no, straight does not mean <em>boring</em>.  But maybe, in this world, it is a bit easier to be straight.  So, if you think you're straight, then good for you, but if you think you're not straight, well then, what are you?  Read on...</p>

<p>LGBT, LGBTQ, LGBTQIA, LGBTIQAPD, LGBTIQA+, LGBT*IQ
<br>Can someone please explain them all?  Read on, or you can go to another website that explains in a lot more detail than me.  The link is <a class="a" href="" title="Outright Action International">over here</a>.</p>

<hr style="border-style: dotted;" />

<h3><i>"but, how will i find out if i'm a lesbian?"</i></h3>

<p>Answer the following questions, and they might help you discover if you are a lesbian, or gay, or bisexual, or pansexual, or omnisexual, or a-new-kind-of-sexual...</p>

<p>Sexuality, or sexual-preference is a funny thing.  Mommy and daddy probably told you that you're going to grow up and get married and make babies, just like they did, and just like they're parents did, but maybe you think you want to grow up and not make babies, maybe you don't want to get married, maybe you don't even want to have the same relationship partner for your whole life.  Maybe you want to experiment, maybe you've already figured it out.  Maybe you like boys!  But you're a boy.  Maybe you like girls!  But you're a girl.  Or maybe it's not that simple, you've got a boyfriend, but you started fancying this girl and now you want to be with them instead, or maybe you want to be with both of them at the same time!  What is happening??</p>
<p>Maybe your family know about your relationships, maybe they don't.  Maybe your friends know about your relationships, maybe they don't.  Maybe you know that your friend is gay, or lesbian, or bisexual, (or straight), but... maybe <em>you</em> don't know your friends as well as you think you do!</p>

<h3><i>"so, I heard that being trans is kind of cool right now"</i></h3>


<hr style="border-style: dotted;" />

<h3><i>"so is queer something to do with fashion? or just a cool word for 'gay'?"</i></h3>

<p><!-- NOT FINISHED-->nonbinary, weird, definition of the word queer, can music be queer, or just people, etc...</p>

<p>*<i>fap fap fap*</i>= the sound you make when you are masturbating, according to various online sources.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it OK to masturbate?</li>
<li>Do other people masturbate as much as me?</li>
<li>Why can't I stop myself from doing it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you ever ask yourself these questions?  Are you concerned that you might be addicted to masturbation?  And do you want to do something about it?
<br>Well, <strong>don't bother</strong>!  There is <strong>nothing</strong> wrong with you.  And if anyone tells you differently, show them this website!</p>
<p>You might have heard about this allegedly 'secular' organisation that wants to cure you of your addiction, it's called <a class="a" href="https://nofap.com/" target="_blank" title="honestly, is this site for real?">nofap.com</a>.  But here's some advice, you should masturbate <em>more</em>!  Not less.  Discover you.  Spend more time with you and yourself.  Only you know what you really like!</p>

# hello-world
this is my way of learning a bit about how to do all this shizz
and also saying a little bit about myself...
...like how i like peanut butter... a LOT!

for language changing... remember this is what is written on credits page:

On Vietnamese page in main folder
<p align="right"><a href="credits.html">Tiếng Việt</a> / <a href="/en/credits.html">English</a></p>

On English page in /en/ folder
<p align="right"><a href="../credits.html">Tiếng Việt</a> / <a href="./credits.html">English</a></p>

in case it gets lost in one of the updates... don't forget plan to rename all English pages to -en.html so there will be some work to do to fix all the links

for language changing on the homepage, here's the code:
on Viet (main) page
<p align="right"><a href=".">Tiếng Việt</a> / <a href="./en/index.html">English</a></p>
on English page
<p align="right"><a href="../index.html">Tiếng Việt</a> / <a href=".">English</a></p>
